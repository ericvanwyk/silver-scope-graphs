# Notes
- Parent scopes may change inside of certain productions, which necessarily means replacing those parent scope non-terminals with new scope non-terminals. This may break in places where a production consists of two sub-trees which take the same parent scope non-terminal as an inherited parent scope. I.e. a situation in which a new scope points to the original parent in the first sub-tree, then the parent scope is updated in the second sub-tree and is not the same non-terminal object, then the new scope created in sub-tree 1 points to the wrong parent node. Is this fine because of lazy evaluation?
